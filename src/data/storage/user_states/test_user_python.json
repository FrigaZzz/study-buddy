Brief Introduction to Decorators\n\nDecorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to modify the behavior of functions or methods. They provide a way to wrap another function, enhancing its functionality without permanently modifying it. This makes decorators an excellent tool for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, access control, memoization, and more.\n\n## 2. Key Concepts and Principles\n\n### What is a Decorator?\n\nA decorator in Python is essentially a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it. This is achieved through a higher-order function, which returns a new function that adds the desired functionality.\n\n### Syntax\n\nDecorators are applied to functions using the `@` symbol followed by the decorator name, placed immediately above the function definition.\n\n```python\ndef my_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper():\n        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n        func()\n        print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n    return wrapper\n\n@my_decorator\ndef say_hello():\n    print(\"Hello!\")\n\nsay_hello()\n```\n\n### Decorator with Arguments\n\nDecorators can also take arguments. This requires an additional layer of function nesting to handle both the decorator arguments and the function being decorated.\n\n```python\ndef repeat(num_times):\n    def decorator_repeat(func):\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            for _ in range(num_times):\n                result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n            return result\n        return wrapper\n    return decorator_repeat\n\n@repeat(num_times=3)\ndef greet(name):\n    print(f\"Hello {name}\")\n\ngreet(\"Alice\")\n```\n\n### Built-in Decorators\n\nPython provides several built-in decorators that are commonly used:\n\n- `@staticmethod`: Marks a method as static, meaning it does not operate on an instance of the class.\n  \n  ```python\n  class MathOperations:\n      @staticmethod\n      def add(a, b):\n          return a + b\n  ```\n\n- `@classmethod`: Allows methods to access and modify the class state that applies across all instances of the class.\n\n  ```python\n  class Circle:\n      pi = 3.14\n      \n      @classmethod\n      def area(cls, radius):\n          return cls.pi * radius ** 2\n  ```\n\n- `@property`: Used for getter methods to access private attributes in a controlled way.\n\n  ```python\n  class Person:\n      def __init__(self, name):\n          self._name = name\n      \n      @property\n      def name(self):\n          return self._name\n  ```\n\n## 3. Examples and Applications\n\n### Logging Decorator\n\nA common use of decorators is to add logging functionality to track the execution of functions.\n\n```python\nimport functools\nimport logging\n\ndef log_decorator(func):\n    @functools.wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n        logging.info(f\"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}\")\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        logging.info(f\"{func.__name__} returned {result}\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@log_decorator\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\nadd_numbers(5, 3)\n```\n\n### Access Control Decorator\n\nDecorators can be used to implement access control by checking user permissions before executing functions.\n\n```python\nfrom functools import wraps\n\ndef requires_permission(permission):\n    def decorator_requires_permission(func):\n        @wraps(func)\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            # Assume 'user_permissions' is a global variable or passed as context\n            if permission in user_permissions:\n                return func(*args, **kwargs)\n            else:\n                raise PermissionError(\"User does not have the required permission.\")\n        return wrapper\n    return decorator_requires_permission\n\n@requires_permission('admin')\ndef admin_task():\n    print(\"Admin task executed\")\n\n# Simulate user permissions\nuser_permissions = ['admin', 'user']\nadmin_task()\n```\n\n### Memoization Decorator\n\nMemoization is a technique to cache the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again.\n\n```python\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return n\n    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n\nprint(fibonacci(10))  # Efficiently calculates the 10th Fibonacci number\n```\n\n## 4. Summary of Main Points\n\n- **Decorators** are functions that modify or enhance the behavior of other functions without altering their code.\n- They use a `@` symbol followed by the decorator name to apply to a function.\n- Decorators can be customized with arguments, allowing for flexible and reusable functionality.\n- Python provides several built-in decorators like `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, and `@property`.\n- Common applications of decorators include logging, access control, memoization, and more.\n\nDecorators are a powerful tool in the Python developer's toolkit, enabling cleaner and more maintainable code by separating cross-cutting concerns from business logic.

  "user_question": "What are the basic data types in Python?",
  "question_response": "        ```python\n\n# Basic Data Types in Python: Tutorial with Examples\n\nIn Python, the basic data types are categorized into four main groups\u2014integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), strings (str), and booleans (bool). Each of these serves a unique purpose within programming tasks. Let's delve deeper into understanding each type:\n\n### Integers (`int`)\nIntegers represent whole numbers in Python, both positive (\"42\") and negative (-10 or -56789), without any decimal points. They can handle very large values but are stored as the closest approximate value due to memory constraints on different systems (limited by `sys.maxsize`). Here's an example:\n```python\nx = 42        # Integer assignment\ny = -10       # Assigning negative integer\nz = sys.maxsize   # Maximum representable positive int in Python, without overflow issues on most systems\nprint(f\"Type of x is {type(x)} and its value is {x}\")\n# Output: Type of x is <class 'int'> and its value is 42\n```\n### Floats (`float`)\nFloating-point numbers represent real numbers with a decimal point or in scientific notation. Python floats can handle very large values, but precision issues might arise due to the way these are stored as binary fractions internally (which cannot perfectly replicate every possible base-10 fraction). Here's an example:\n```python0_3758  # Assigning float value with scientific notation and a decimal point.\nprint(f\"Type of y is {type(y)} and its value is {y}\")\n# Output: Type of y is <class 'float'> and its value is -1e-42 (a very small number) or 3758000000.3758 in another run, depending on Python's floating-point representation for that particular version/run\n```\n### Strings (`str`)\nStrings are sequences of characters enclosed within quotes: either single ('Hello') or double (\"World\"). They can be indexed and sliced to access substrings but cannot perform mathematical operations. Here\u2019s an example showcasing basic string manipulation techniques like indexing, concatenation (joining), length checking (`len()`) as well as some common errors that occur when strings are treated as numbers:\n```python0_4219  # Concatenating two strings using '+' operator to create a longer text.\nprint(f\"Type of z is {type(z)} and its value before conversion back to int is '{z}'\")  \n# Output: Type of z is <class 'str'> (confirming string type)\n#         And, converting the float back into an integer gives 3758000000 which may vary slightly based on Python version/run and system architecture. It\u2019s not a literal conversion from str to int but shows how we can convert strings containing numbers again using 'int()' function\n```\n### Booleans (`bool`)\nPython booleans are used to represent truth values\u2014`True` or `False`. They are very important for controlling flow and conditions in programming. Here\u2019s an example where boolean logic is employed, showing comparison operations which return a bool type:\n```python0_4563  # Using 'and' operator between two booleans to evaluate their joint truth value.\nprint(f\"Type of result from comparisons are {type(a)} and {result}\")  \n# Output: Type of result from the comparison is <class 'bool'> (confirming boolean type) with True or False, depending on whether x was greater than y as per condition in if statement above.\n```\n## Common Mistakes & Errors when Mixing Data Types \nIt's important to remember that Python data types have their own specific methods and operations associated with them; mixing improperly (like using mathematical operators or comparisons) can lead to errors:\n1. **String as a Number** - Attempting arithmetic on strings will raise an error, for example `a + b` where 'a' is `\"Hello\"` & 'b' represents numerical data would result in TypeError due to type mismatches between string and integer/float types. Always ensure compatibility before performing operations across different basic python datatypes:\n```python0_5378  # This will raise a TypeError as we are trying to add an integer with a string, which is not allowed by Python's syntax rules or data type constraints for that specific run of the code (resulting in error) - but can be fixed using appropriate methods like str() conversion.\na = \"Hello\" + 5   # This will raise TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'str' and 'int'. Use a proper method to convert integers into strings or vice verssive, e.g., f-string formatting below where the int value is explicitly converted back as string\nprint(\"a =\", a);   # Output should be something like \"TypeError\" (in our case) but in another run/version of Python it will raise Error: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'str' and 'int'. \n# Or using str() conversion, to get desired output as shown below. But generally strings & integers cannot be directly added together without explicit conversions between them (using int() or str()).\na = f\"{x} {y}\"   # Converted integer back into string for successful concatenation via formatted string literal/f-string syntax in Python 3.6+ as the best way to mix strings and integers, converting '5' directly inside an f-string like above without explicit conversions: \"a = Hello World\";\nprint(f\"Type of a is {type(a)} with its value '{a}'\")  \n# Output (successful): Type of result from comparisons are <class 'bool'> and True or False, depending on if x > y - boolean outcome. And for the string-integer mix: \"a = Hello World\"; confirmed as a str data type in Python 3+ syntax with desired output format using f-string formatting technique (introduced postponed till recent versions).\n```\n## Conclusion of Main Points from Basic Data Types Introduction Tutorial & Error Handling Insights\nThis tutorial highlighted the basic types available to python and their respective operations, along with common error handling insights that arise when they are inappropriately mixed or used. Always remember: different data type variables require specific methods/operations applicable only to them (like arithmetic for integers but not strings). Python programming requires understanding of these constraints as well how one can convert between datatypes where required, avoiding potential run-time errors and ensuring code robustness & maintainability in the long term.\n```",
